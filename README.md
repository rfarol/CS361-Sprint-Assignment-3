# CS361-Sprint-Assignment-3

For my Spring Assignment 3, I have created a Content Generator GUI using Tkinter. I have used the following packages and modules:

Tkinter
CSV (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
Wikipediaiapi (https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/)
Beauitful Soup (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Since it was my first time using Tkinter, I watched a YouTube video as an example and followed a couple of tutorials. The links below were specifically used for widget implementation and placement.
