# CS361-Sprint-Assignment-3

For my Spring Assignment 3, I have created a Content Generator GUI using Tkinter. I used the following packages and modules:

Tkinter

CSV (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

Wikipediaiapi (https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/)

Beauitful Soup (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Since it was my first time using Tkinter, I watched a YouTube video as an example and followed a couple of tutorials. The links below were specifically used for widget implementation and placement.

For the input csv file, it needs to contain a header and columns containing two search words. If using Excel, keep them within the same cell and they must be separated by a semicolon (;). An example CSV file can be found within the repo called input.csv.
